00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.880
It's made

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.260
me want

3
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.600
to learn

4
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:01.760
more.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.200
It's not made me just want to stop there.

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.400
It's made me want to progress my career.

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.760
It's very manageable.

5
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.320
Nothing to be scared of at all. 

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
It's confidence, and it's an optimism that I now have. 

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.680
I've enjoyed working at home, at my own pace.

8
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.040
Really, really got me thinking. 

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.320
Over the moon. I was completely overjoyed. 

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.640
It's given me confidence to go on and study

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.000
and hopefully lead to me gaining a degree.

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.880
I think it's one of the best things I've done really. 

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.840
I felt quite elated

14
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.600
that I'd actually taken that step and done it. 

15
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.640
It's just a feeling of having tried something new

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
and succeeded.

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.280
On top of the world.

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.040
And I can't wait to do the next course. 

19
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.160
I have really, really enjoyed it. 

20
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
And it's given me a thirst for knowledge 

21
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.960
and I want to carry on doing it.
